# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset 

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and supporting files for **Task 2**, where we perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.

## Objective

The goal of this task is to:
- Understand the dataset structure and variables
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Engineer new features
- Visualize relationships between features and survival
- Identify top predictors for modeling

##  Key Features Explored

- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
- SibSp & Parch (combined into FamilySize)
- Embarked
- Survival

## Techniques Used

- Correlation matrix and heatmaps
- Boxplots and histograms
- Pairplots for multivariate analysis
- Feature engineering (`FamilySize`)
- Dropping redundant or low-impact features

##  Files in this Repository

- `task2_eda.ipynb` - Main notebook with all analysis steps
- `README.md` - Project overview

## Notes

- This task is part of a larger Titanic Machine Learning project.
- All visualizations were created using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
